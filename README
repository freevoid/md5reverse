Overview
--------

This tiny script is intended to be used as md5 reverse mechanism.
It can be used directly from shell:

./md5reverse.py <md5_hex_digest>

Or as a simple unary function from python code:

>>> import hashlib, md5reverse
>>> md5sum = lambda hash: hashlib.md5(hash).hexdigest()
>>> md5reverse.md5reverse(md5sum("admin"))
u'admin'

Script using http://md5.noisette.ch/ as MD5 hash DB.

For further info about possible exceptions and graceful variant
graceful_md5reverse, see the code.

Requirements
------------

There is a single requirement: BeautifulSoup library.
